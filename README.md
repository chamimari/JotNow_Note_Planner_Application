# JotNow Note Planner Application
A note planner application created in Visual Basic with VB.NET, from a Group Project in my Visual Programming class.

JotNow is a planner app, designed to help people keep things in order, or to just note down simple things as well. With a calender and multi-entry system, JotNow strives to help the user record their tasks without being a nusance during their work.
